# Tahoe Notes
An application for creating local notes on macOS with tasks, markdown (read markdown guide), export and Drag&Drop images. This application is written in swift and is inspired by the design of macOS 26 Tahoe. It provides a simple and convenient replacement for the built-in notes application. This application does not have and will never have any connection with cloud services, which guarantees the security of your personal data. 

## Working with markdown: 
To work with markdowns, I created a separate file in this repository. Please study it to understand how to work with the application.

## Export: 
The notes are exported via files with the extension .md, which allows you to view files from obsidian in this program, as well as files from this program in obsidian. 

## Installation: 
Download the file TahoeNotes.app from releases, move it to other programs in finder.

## Further development of the program: 
In the future, it is planned to add as many interesting features as possible from obsidian and other file management applications. Also, after updating the application for macOS, it is planned to release this application on android and linux. The development of this program for Windows and, especially, iOS, is not planned, but it may be.
